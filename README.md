# blog-plug-in-psqr
My first Micro.blog plugin. This is the plugin you need if you want to serve arbitrary files on your blog.

Motivated because I needed [to create a top-level folder for PSQR](https://help.micro.blog/t/create-top-level-folder-mkdir-equivalent-of-creating-a-folder-create-path/2021). And about that, see me for instructions on how to create identity.json, used by [EncycloCrawler](https://gitlab.com/ks_found/encyclocrawler). Needed to participate in the encyclosphere ([project home page](https://encyclosphere.org)). Actually anyone who wants to store their PSQR identity for any reason can use this plugin.
